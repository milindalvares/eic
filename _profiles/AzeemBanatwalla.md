Azeem Banatwalla is one of India’s top comics and sharpest comedy writers, known for his sharp wit and intelligent stand-up. With excellent command over the English language, he’s performed across India, Asia, the UK, and Australia, and is one of very few Indian comics with international credits and truly universal material that transcends cultural boundaries. He was one of the first few comics in India to land a stand-up special (Cometh the Hour) on Amazon Prime Video, which garnered much critical acclaim. His second special is expected in late 2018. He also has international TV and radio credits to his name, having appeared on ABC’s Comedy Up Late (Australia), and ABC’s Comedy Bites. He was the headlining act on both the Comedy Zone Asia lineup and Indian All-Star Showcase for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival 2018, along with featuring on the MICF Roadshow across Australia, with a total of 42 shows over 45 days. He was also a guest performer at several showcases on the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2017.

As a writer, Azeem has a strong journalistic background, having written features and columns for publications including National Geographic Traveller, The Man, TechTree, The Deccan Chronicle, Scroll, and Indian Video Gamer, amongst others. 

At EIC, he’s the lead writer and creative director of the news comedy show EIC Outrage, along with writing for sketches and branded content, and has written for the likes of Shah Rukh Khan, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Karan Johar, amongst others.
