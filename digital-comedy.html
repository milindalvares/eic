					Being selfless comedy heroes, we create tons of digital content (or “viral videos” as some simpletons call them) for our YouTube, Facebook and Instagram platforms– from sketches to song parodies to talk-show panels and stand-up comedy clips.

					<p class="comedy-video-para">
						An honest, balanced news comedy show with sharp writing and detailed research into burning topics that people are talking about. Over the years, EIC Outrage has slowly transformed into an unofficial news source for the Indian youth. We’ve completed two incredible seasons which have been critically acclaimed by news publications, activists, and even politicians, although we’ll take that last one with a pinch of salt.

					<p class="comedy-video-para">
						What started as a spiritual successor to the very popular Ghanta Awards, EIC vs Bollywood was a show that ripped on Bollywood movies. Over the years, it’s evolved and become a panel show where we explore some of Bollywood’s brightest minds (they do exist), from actors to directors, to gain insight into the industry and see Bollywood stars chilling out and talking about silly things.

					<p class="comedy-video-para">
						EIC vs The World season 1 premiered on Amazon Prime Video in 2017 and is the quintessential show about nothing. Four comedians sit around a table, have a few drinks and tell funny stories and anecdotes. Turn it on and you’ll have binge-watched the season before you know it! The latest season is now out on YouTube too!

						We’re terrible singers, but half decent writers. As a combination, that leads to parody song videos about funny, relatable content that’s garnered millions of views over the last couple of years. Some of our most popular songs include The Modi Song, The Donald Trump Song and The Goa Song.
