Angad entered the world of stand-up through an Indian culture approved route, by first completing his Engineering and MBA. He has performed in over 1000 shows across India and South East Asia. 

In 2017, he toured the country with his solo special Kaafi Filmy which is featured on Amazon Prime Video. He is know for his clean relatable comedy and his stand-up videos have over 10 million views across social media platforms yet his father still says "Marunga dus, ginunga ek". He has written for award shows like IIFA and Life OK Screen Awards for celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor and Siddharth Malhotra. He claims that Rahul Dravid once said to him "Good work, dude" but there is no way to verify it.
