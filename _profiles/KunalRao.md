Kunal is a retired chartered accountant who realised that creative accounting was frowned upon.
His two comedy hours “Holy Krao!” and “It’s Not Okay”, successfully toured India in 2012 and 2015 respectively. A co-founder of East India Comedy, Kunal has performed over 1000 shows across India. He is known for his insightful twist on human behaviour, while adding a touch of personal morbidity and self-deprecation.
Kunal has performed across Europe, USA and Asia, with special performances at Utrecht Comedy Festival (The Netherlands), and Magners International Comedy Festival, apart from his already prolific presence in India.
