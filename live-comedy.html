					We have five of India’s funniest stand-up comics, who’ve racked up millions of views across YouTube, Facebook and Amazon Prime Video.
				</p>
				<p>
					We’ve had sold out shows at India’s most prestigious venues, from the smallest comedy rooms to multi-thousand-seater auditoriums as solo artists and as group shows. Heck, we even opened for Coldplay in front of 80,000 people! People follow us to our shows abroad as well – we’ve done sold out shows in Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Melbourne, amongst others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of our artists are regulars at international comedy festivals like the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we’re saying is, we’ve been around the block a few times – <span class="texthighlight"> we know how to make people laugh! </span>

				<p class="lead">We love performing at college festivals! College audiences are the most kick-ass, loving audiences we get to perform to, and we’re always happy to rock up and bask in the validation you boys and girls offer us. We can customize content for your college festival and do jokes around it, because when you look back at your college life, you’ll laugh anyway. <strong> We offer special deals for college festivals, including a combination of stand-up and live music acts </strong>, because we’re multi-talented like that.</p>
				<p>Some of the colleges we’ve performed at are – IIT Guwahati, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, ISB Hyderabad, NMIMS, AIIMS, BITS Pilani, BITS Goa, BITS Hyderabad, Whistling Woods, Symbiosis Pune, IIIT Hyderabad, IIM Ahmedabad, MICA Ahmedabad, NIT K, NIT Trichy.</p>

				<p class="lead">Name your event, and we will funny it up. Public shows, corporate events, private parties (we charge extra to jump out of a cake), we do it all. If you can organize a mic, an audience, and a briefcase filled with money (plus GST), we’ve got you covered! We’ve been doing clean, corporate comedy since 2012, and have a whole list of happy clients who’ve had us perform at conferences, parties, offsites, awards ceremonies, and other creative things that event management agencies come up with.</p>
				<p>We’re mindful of the maturity and tact that goes with corporate and family-oriented shows, and are happy to tweak our content according to what your crowd is comfortable with. Just let us know what you want, on a scale of Alok Nath to Anurag Kashyap.</p>
				<p>If you want customized material, and want us to write exclusive brand new jokes about say jewelry, we could make that happen, but just like jewelry, customized jokes can be expensive (wink wink).</p>
